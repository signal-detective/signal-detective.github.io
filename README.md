# Covid-Data

**Pandemic Signal Detective: [signal-detective.github.io](https://signal-detective.github.io/)**

A classroom activity about which kind of data warns us first when a wave of disease
starts. Four interactive activities and six quiz questions, built on six COVID-19
indicator signals for all 50 US states and DC, June 2020 to March 2022, collected from
the [Delphi Epidata API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/) at Carnegie Mellon
University.

Nothing to install and no sign-in. Students open the link and work down the page.

`pandemic_signal_detective.ipynb` is the same four activities as a Google Colab notebook,
for anyone who wants to see the Python behind them.

This file exists so that a classroom can load the data in one download. The Delphi
API allows only 60 requests per hour per internet address, and a school network
usually shares one address, so sending every student to the API does not work.

## The file

`covid_signals_by_state.csv` has one row per state per day:

| Column | Kind of data | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | | Two-letter postal code |
| `date` | | Day, from 2020-06-01 to 2022-03-31 |
| `searches` | Online behavior | Google searches for loss of smell or taste (`google-symptoms`) |
| `survey` | Social media survey | % of Facebook survey takers reporting COVID-like illness (`fb-survey`) |
| `doctor` | Insurance claims | % of doctor visits for COVID-like illness (`doctor-visits`) |
| `cases` | Lab testing | New positive tests per 100,000 people, 7-day average (`jhu-csse`) |
| `hospital` | Hospital reports | New COVID hospital admissions per 100,000 people (`hhs`) |
| `deaths` | Death records | COVID deaths per 100,000 people, 7-day average (`jhu-csse`) |

Blank cells mean no data was reported, not zero. The `searches` signal is missing
entirely for eight smaller states (AK, DC, DE, MT, ND, SD, VT, WY), because Google
suppresses low-volume counts, and it stops in January 2022.

Territories (AS, GU, MP, PR, VI) are present in the file but have very sparse coverage.
